Contains games that have specific assets depending on system. Mostly specific music for old systems. All common assets are stored here and specific ones are from parent folder. Games that use such specific assets for systems have a different naming convention from parent folder, they include systems that use those specific assets as well. For example castle of illusion game has a different music from gamegear/mastersystem and megadrive, in this case from parent folder we may found *castle_of_illusion_gamegear_mastersystem* and *castle_of_illusion_megadrive* folder games. Never use folders stored here directly and always choose one from parent folder.
