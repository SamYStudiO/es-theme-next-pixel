### Hi and welcome to [Next Pixel theme](https://samystudio.github.io/es-theme-next-pixel/) for [Recalbox](https://www.recalbox.com/)
This theme is designed to display a full screen image for every system that matches a game box illustration or artwork at the time game was released. All systems will randomly display a different game theme each time Recalbox is started (at least 2 game themes are available for each system).
It is based on recabox-next theme so you'll get all advantages of it (region settings, game list layout settings, etc..) + several options so you can get a visual that suits you. 

**Theme is configured by default to use a custom mix to scrap your game images, please read carefully documentation below to get more info even if you don't want to use it as you'll have to adjust theme GAMELISTVIEW option to get it work properly with others mixes**.

**Theme is compatible with Recalbox 7.0+ and with 16:9, 4:3 and small 4:3 screens like GPi CASE**.

Here are some screenshots of some available game themes :

- **THEME REGION** : choose your region to adjust logo/console to match your preferred region.


### Scraping / Next Pixel mix
Next Pixel theme includes its own custom mix to make your game screenshots and video snaps integration even better. If you never heard of mixes, they're just these images you may download along with game info/description using Recalbox internal scraper or using an external scraper like [Skraper](https://www.skraper.net/). Better than a long description here are 2 captures using standard mix and using Next Pixel mix.

**Standard mix**

### Download
Several packages are available depending on your screen ratio and resolution. Actually theme fully supports 16:9 and 4:3 screens.

#### 16:9 screens
3 packages are available with 1080p images (full hd screens, 4K, 8K), 720p images (hd screens) or 480p images (intended for Raspberry users).

**If you are a Raspberry Pi user please read carefully next lines (PC/Odroid users can skip to download links and grab package that match best their screen resolution)**.
Raspberry Pi may lead to memory issues when using a lot of images. 720p package is the right way to go even if you're on a big screen tv 1080p/4K/8K. **I highly recommend to force Recalbox to run at 720p if your screen is running higher resolution, as it will improve performances and images quality**. To do so you'll have to edit [config.txt](https://github.com/recalbox/recalbox-os/wiki/Edit-the-config.txt-file-(EN)) using PuTTy or WinSCP.

**Don't forget to allow write access before modify your file**.
- If you're using PuTTy use *mount -o remount,rw /boot* commmand.
- If you're using WinSCP open console (Ctrl + T), enter command *mount -o remount,rw /boot* and click Execute.

From this file search for *hdmi_group* and *hdmi_mode* and set both as following :
- hdmi_group=1
- hdmi_mode=4

Don't forget to remove '#' char on those lines if present.

If you still have issues with 720p (mainly images replaced with white rectangle) **and you already have forced Recalbox to run at 720p** you may try to allocate more gpu memory. Edit the same [config.txt](https://github.com/recalbox/recalbox-os/wiki/Edit-the-config.txt-file-(EN)) file, this time search for *gpu_mem_1024=448* and set it to *gpu_mem_1024=512* and once again **Don't forget to allow write access before modify your file**.

**Warning : PSP emulator may not work anymore, so if you're not using PSP system this shouldn't be a problem**.

If you don't want to change memory settings or you're using PSP system then you should switch to 480p package, images quality will be less sharp but you should be able to use lots of systems without issues.

[Download](https://github.com/SamYStudiO/es-theme-next-pixel/releases) previous packages for Recalbox 6.1 or lower.

#### 4:3 screens
2 packages are available with 1024x768 images and 320x240 images, if you're using a screen with higher resolution than 320x240 pick **crt package**, if you're using 320x240 or lower screen (like GPi CASE) pick **crt-small package**. **If you're using 1024x768 package with a screen with higher resolution than 1024x768, I highly recommend to force Recalbox to run at the same resolution as it will improve performances and images quality**. To do so you'll have to edit [config.txt](https://github.com/recalbox/recalbox-os/wiki/Edit-the-config.txt-file-(EN)) using PuTTy or [WinSCP](https://github.com/recalbox/recalbox-os/wiki/Network-access-with-WinSCP-(EN)).

**Don't forget to allow write access before modify your file**.
- If you're using PuTTy use *mount -o remount,rw /boot* commmand.
- If you're using WinSCP open console (Ctrl + T), enter command *mount -o remount,rw /boot* and click Execute.

From this file search for *hdmi_group* and *hdmi_mode* and set both as following :
- hdmi_group=2
- hdmi_mode=16
